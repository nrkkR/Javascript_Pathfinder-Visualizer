# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

## Description
Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer is a tool to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and A* Algorithm. This software helps in understanding how different pathfinding algorithms work by finding the shortest path between two points on a grid.

## Features
- **Algorithm Dropdown**: Select between Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm.
- **Interactive Grid**: Click to set start and end points, add walls, and drag points.
- **Visualization**: Watch the algorithm in action, highlighting visited nodes and the final path.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization.
- **Clear Grid**: Reset the grid to its initial state.


## Usage
Upon opening the application, you will be greeted with the main interface where you can:

1. **Set Start and End Points**: Click on the grid to set the start (green) and end (red) points.
2. **Add Walls**: Click on any cell to toggle it as a wall (black). Walls act as obstacles.
3. **Drag Points**: Click and drag the start or end points to move them.
4. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose between Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm from the dropdown menu.
5. **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider to control the speed of the visualization.
6. **Start Visualization**: Click the "Start" button to see the algorithm in action.
7. **Clear Grid**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the grid.
